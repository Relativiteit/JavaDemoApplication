Demo-Java-Application
## Introduction

This application is the backend side of the dummy application. 

## Goal
The application must contain the following:
- main class initiates data storage, does sequential exection with threads, manipulate data(edit, add, remove)
- unit testing 
- Give the state of the database: empty, filled, test the operations, last operation will end with a different state of the database.
- Database example, use hashmap to hardcode values, and check if they were manipulated correctly.
- Exeption handeling
- Differentiate between colletion methods, cons and pro's for example sorting duplicate keys (hashmap cannot cotain duplicates)
- UML schematic of layers of the application, entry point, business logic, data layer
